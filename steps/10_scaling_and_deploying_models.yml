              Time to learn about scaling and deploying models - a critical skill that separates experimental work from production-ready ML systems.
          - text: |
              Deployment is where many ML projects fail. A model that works in your notebook but can't handle real users, latency requirements, or scale isn't providing any business value.
          - text: |
              Chapter 19 covers TensorFlow Serving, cloud deployment strategies, model versioning, and monitoring. 

              Pay special attention to latency optimization, handling model updates without downtime, and setting up proper monitoring to catch performance issues early.
