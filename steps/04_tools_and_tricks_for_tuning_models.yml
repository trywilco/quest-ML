learningObjectives:
  - Identify methods used for hyperparameter tuning in Scikit-Learn.
hints:
  - Think about automated tools that systematically search through hyperparameter combinations.
  - Review Chapter 5 "Support Vector Machines" - particularly the sections on hyperparameter tuning with C, gamma, and kernel parameters for SVMs.
  - "Consider what makes hyperparameter tuning efficient: automation and cross-validation combined."

              Great work mastering Scikit-Learn's core concepts! 

              Now that you understand estimators, predictors, transformers, and pipelines, let's explore how to optimize them.

              Once you have a working model, the next crucial step is **hyperparameter tuning** - finding the best configuration to maximize your model's performance.

              As covered in Chapter 5 on Support Vector Machines, hyperparameters like `C` control the balance between margin maximization and classification accuracy.

                      Excellent! 

                      As explained in Chapter 5, reducing `C` makes the street larger and leads to more margin violations. 

                      This increases regularization, creating a simpler model that's less prone to overfitting but may have lower training accuracy.
