learningObjectives:
  - Understand the main components of a neural network and their functions.
hints:
  - Check out a [Comprehensive Guide on Neural Networks](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/neural-networks) for more
    information.
  - Explore Chapter 10 - Introduction to Artificial Neural Networks to understand the basic architecture and layer types.
  - Look at the "The Perceptron" section in Chapter 10 to see how data flows through different layers.
  - Think about how data enters the network, gets processed, and produces an output - each stage corresponds to a different layer type.

              We've journeyed through the fundamentals of machine learning, and now we're venturing into one of its most powerful frontiers - neural networks!

              Just as our quest has built understanding layer by layer, neural networks themselves are built from interconnected layers of artificial neurons.

              In Chapter 10, we learn that neural networks are organized in a specific structure with different types of layers, each serving a unique purpose in processing data.

            Please evaluate the user's answer in relation to the expected answer: I expect the user to name the three types of layers in a basic neural network: input layer, hidden layer(s), and output layer.

            # Assessment Criteria
            - Check if they mention the three types of layers: input, hidden, and output layers
            - Consider synonyms, paraphrasing, and different phrasing that convey the same meaning (e.g., 'hidden layers' vs 'intermediate layers')
            - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the answer rather than exact wording
            - They should identify at least 2 of the 3 layer types to show understanding

            # Response Guidelines:
            - If the user's answer is correct or shows sufficient understanding, return 'correct: true'
              - Provide a positive and affirming message, congratulating them and reinforcing their understanding
            - If the user's answer is incorrect or incomplete, return 'correct: false'
              - Gently explain why the answer is not fully correct or what may be missing
              - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic and supportive

            # Tone and Style:
            - Use friendly and encouraging language
            - Be empathetic to the user's learning process
            - Focus on helping the user learn and understand the material
